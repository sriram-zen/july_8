        ## **Product Concept** 

        Implement digital receipt automation for digital donations using mature, admin-only compatible platforms to achieve immediate and substantial time savings. Maintain manual processes for cash donations, but streamline backend workflows where possible. Approach WhatsApp automation as a phased pilot only, with strict compliance and donor engagement monitoring. Establish ongoing compliance, privacy, and technical audit protocols for all automation initiatives. Document actual costs, compliance outcomes, and donor engagement impacts during implementation to inform future improvements and sector benchmarking.
